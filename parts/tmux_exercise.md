### Exercise: tmux

0. open up the terminal
1. connect to a remote that has tmux installed. If your remote doesn't have it, install tmux on your (local) machine instead.
2. make a new tmux session and connect to it
3. once inside of the session, do some work (change directory, open some files, create tmux windows, etc.)
4. disconnect from the session, either using the keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, then <kbd>D</kbd>) or the command (`tmux detach`)
5. disconnect from the remote and connect again
6. connect to the same session and verify that all of your work is still there
