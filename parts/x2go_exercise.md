### Exercise: x2go (_optional_)

0. Make sure you have a remote at your disposal that has an x2go server running
1. Install an x2go client on your machine
2. Make a new session for that remote. If the remote doesn't have a full desktop environment (like XFCE, KDE, GNOME), you will need to specify which command to run in the _Command_ submenu of _Session type_.
3. Connect to the remote and do some work in that window, then either press the pause button, or close the remote window.
4. Close and re-open the x2go application.
5. Connect to the remote again. You should pick up exactly where you left off!
